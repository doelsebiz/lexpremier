Things like ambulance services and prescription drugs may not be covered and you could end up paying out of pocket for some of the services you need.</p>

                      Travel insurance offers protection against unexpected events that can happen before or during traveling. Traveling insurance will cover both minor and major accidents. Generally, basic insurance plans cover emergency medical costs, whereas, an all-inclusive policy normally covers flight delays, trip cancellation, baggage lost, and more. Keep in mind that most of the companies will not cover the risks listed on the Government of Canada’s travel advisory site.
