                      <p>Check to see if there is disability insurance available through your workplace, in which case your employer may cover part of your premiums. Consider purchasing a policy on your own if coverage at the workplace is insuficient to meet your needs or if workplace coverage is not available to you. Ways to buy a policy on your own include going through a professional association, contacting an insurance broker, reaching out to an insurance company. Take the time to understand the policy you are buying, and don’t be afraid to ask any questions about what your disability insurance policy covers.</p>

                    <p> Every disability insurance policy imposes a waiting period, also known as the elimination period. This reference is to the number of days you must be disabled before receiving benefits, and the first check will come within 30 days of the end of this period. In other words, if you are disabled during the elimination period, you will not receive any benefits, even though you cannot work. Many people select an elimination period of 60 to 90 days. Shorter elimination periods, such as 30 or 60 days, can mean higher premiums and vice versa.</p>

                              Up to 40% of Canadians face disability for 90 days or more before the age of 65. While both the Canadian pension plan and Quebec pension plan offer disability coverage but there are significant limitations. That’s where disability insurance comes in. It will help you meet your financial responsibilities during the disability period.
