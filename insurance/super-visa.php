Insurance providers check to see if you were medically stable during the “look-back period,” which is typically a period of 60 to 180 days prior to a plan’s effective date. If it is determined that you were not medically stable during that time, you are considered to have a pre-existing condition. Any fallout due to that condition won’t be covered by a standard travel insurance policy..</p>

                    In case of Emergency you have to notify your insurance company as soon as possible of any emergency medical treatment or hospitalization. Your insurer will provide you with assistance, suggest the best options on where to get help, as well as arrange direct billing where possible. Failure to do so could result in decreasing your insurance benefit. Every insurance company has a toll free emergency phone number to call from Canada and collect call numbers to call from anywhere else. The phone numbers are always included in the policy.
