                     Travel insurance is different than extended health insurance. While many extended health insurance plans include some coverage for travel, it is often a small amount. If you get sick or injured while outside of Canada, medical costs can add up quickly – especially if you are hospitalized. Because of this, we recommend that you purchase insurance specific for travelling, even if you have some coverage under another plan. This will ensure that you have enough coverage for an emergency. Travel insurance policies can also include benefits or features that are not provided by group health insurance plans; these include non-medical benefits and 24/7 claims and emergency assistance.

                      You are not required to purchase additional insurance while travelling outside of your home province (but within Canada); however, it is strongly advised to get yourself some anyway. While your provincial health insurance will remain in effect outside of your province of residence, it is limited to expenses which would be covered in your home province. Because of the potential discrepancies in health care coverage from province to province, we recommend purchasing travel insurance. Plans for travel within Canada are available at very reasonable rates.

                      This represents the amount of eligible medical expenses that must be paid by the insured before the insurance company begins to reimburse for covered expenses. As an example, if you purchase a plan with a $50 deductible and incur $200 of expenses, the insurance company will begin to reimburse for expenses after you have paid the first $50 of your medical bills.<br>
                      There are two different kinds of deductibles,&nbsp;<strong>per-claim</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>per-policy period</strong>. A per claim deductible means that the insured must pay a new deductible for each separate incident. (Example: pay the deductible once for a broken leg and then a second time for a flu treatment). A per-policy period deductible means that the insured must pay the deductible only once during the period of the insurance policy. If your plan has a $100 deductible, you pay the first $100 of the expenses and then the insurance company picks up the rest. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium cost and vice versa.

Each insurance company treats pre-existing conditions differently and this is a major reason for declined medical claims.

                      Whenever possible, the insurance companies will try to coordinate direct payment with the hospital so that you do not have to pay out of pocket. It is important that you contact your insurer’s Claims and Emergency Assistance department if you are in need of medical attention. This department will help you get the medical attention you need while attempting to coordinate payment at the facility where you are being treated. However, be aware that some medical facilities may insist on payment up front. If your policy has a deductible, this means that you will be responsible for a portion of the medical expenses incurred. This deductible is a dollar amount that you must pay before coverage kicks in. Deductibles vary from policy to policy, and can be applied on a per-claim or per-trip basis.
