                              Life insurance, simply put, is insurance that will pay out a death benefit (lump sum of money) to a beneficiary (person you name who you want the money to go to) upon the death of the life insured. The cost of life insurance varies based on a number of factors, such as, the age of the insured, smoking status, current health, and expected life expectancy. In exchange of premiums paid (monthly or annual payment made to insurance company), the insurer guarantees to pay a set amount of money to your beneficiary if you pass away during the life of the policy.

This is why you should discuss with your advisor the different life events that will bring on different needs and what applies to you.

                              It's impossible to say, because the kind of coverage thatâ€™s right for you depends on your circumstances and financial goals. But, as stated it is highly recommended that you look at creating a plan that utilizes a combination of both. Term offers the greatest coverage (death benefit) for the lowest initial premium and is a great solution for people with temporary needs or a limited budget. Permanent insurance on the other hand, may make more sense if you anticipate a need for lifelong protection, or if the option of accumulating tax-deferred cash values is attractive to you.  Often, a combination of term and permanent insurance is the right answer.

                              An annual plan allows you to take any number of trips outside your Canadian home province or territory of residence that do not exceed your selected trip duration. Benefit limits are per insured per each trip, unless otherwise indicated. If your trip outside Canada is longer than your selected trip duration then you must top-up your coverage with us. If you do not top-up then you will not have coverage for any claim during your trip regardless of when the cause for claim arises.  You have the option to have the policy start date be the date of purchase or any date into the future up to a maximum of 120 days.

                              Determining how much life insurance you need requires an examination of your current and future financial obligations, along with the resources your family could tap.<br>
                              <br>
                              Your future obligations are a combination of what it would cost to help your surviving family members meet immediate and ongoing needs like funeral costs, taxes, food, clothing, utilities, mortgage payments, and your future obligations like college and retirement funding.<br>
                              <br>
                              The resources that your surviving family members could draw on to meet those obligations include your spouseâ€™s or partnerâ€™s income, savings and investments, other income producing assets, and any life insurance you might already own.<br>
                              <br>
                              The difference between the twoâ€”your financial obligations minus the resources your family has to meet those obligationsâ€”is the approximate amount of additional life insurance you need. If this sounds confusing, youâ€™re not alone. Thatâ€™s why most people turn to a qualified insurance professional when they want to figure out how much insurance they need.<br>
                              <br>
                              But if you donâ€™t feel youâ€™re ready to speak with an agent or want a preliminary sense of your needs before meeting with an agent, visit our Life Insurance Needs Calculator. It will walk you through the various questions you need to ask yourself and provide you with a rough estimate of how much life insurance you need to protect your family.

                              Many policies contain a provision that allows a terminally ill person to collect a significant portion of his or her policyâ€™s death benefit while still alive. The money can be used to get family finances in order, pay for uncovered medical expenses, or simply do certain things for your family or friends while you still can. Itâ€™s important to note that the amount taken out while still living is subtracted from the death benefit payments your beneficiaries receive, along with an interest charge for early payment of benefits.

Moreover, it will make sure that your family can maintain good life quality during your critical illness period.

                              There is a huge difference between life insurance and critical illness insurance. Term or permanent life insurance is a benefit that will be paid to your family and beneficiaries after your death. On the other hand, in critical illness insurance, you will be the one to receive reimbursements for critical illness, not your family or beneficiaries. Furthermore, illness does not need to be terminal to collect benefits.

                              Life insurance, simply put, is insurance that will pay out a death benefit (lump sum of money) to a beneficiary (person you name who you want the money to go to) upon the death of the life insured. The cost of life insurance varies based on a number of factors, such as, the age of the insured, smoking status, current health, and expected life expectancy. In exchange of premiums paid (monthly or annual payment made to insurance company), the insurer guarantees to pay a set amount of money to your beneficiary if you pass away during the life of the policy.

This is why you should discuss with your advisor the different life events that will bring on different needs and what applies to you.

                              It's impossible to say, because the kind of coverage thatâ€™s right for you depends on your circumstances and financial goals. But, as stated it is highly recommended that you look at creating a plan that utilizes a combination of both. Term offers the greatest coverage (death benefit) for the lowest initial premium and is a great solution for people with temporary needs or a limited budget. Permanent insurance on the other hand, may make more sense if you anticipate a need for lifelong protection, or if the option of accumulating tax-deferred cash values is attractive to you.  Often, a combination of term and permanent insurance is the right answer.

                              Determining how much life insurance you need requires an examination of your current and future financial obligations, along with the resources your family could tap.<br>
                              <br>
                              Your future obligations are a combination of what it would cost to help your surviving family members meet immediate and ongoing needs like funeral costs, taxes, food, clothing, utilities, mortgage payments, and your future obligations like college and retirement funding.<br>
                              <br>
                              The resources that your surviving family members could draw on to meet those obligations include your spouseâ€™s or partnerâ€™s income, savings and investments, other income producing assets, and any life insurance you might already own.<br>
                              <br>
                              The difference between the twoâ€”your financial obligations minus the resources your family has to meet those obligationsâ€”is the approximate amount of additional life insurance you need. If this sounds confusing, youâ€™re not alone. Thatâ€™s why most people turn to a qualified insurance professional when they want to figure out how much insurance they need.<br>
                              <br>

                              Many policies contain a provision that allows a terminally ill person to collect a significant portion of his or her policyâ€™s death benefit while still alive. The money can be used to get family finances in order, pay for uncovered medical expenses, or simply do certain things for your family or friends while you still can. Itâ€™s important to note that the amount taken out while still living is subtracted from the death benefit payments your beneficiaries receive, along with an interest charge for early payment of benefits.

                              Life insurance, simply put, is insurance that will pay out a death benefit (lump sum of money) to a beneficiary (person you name who you want the money to go to) upon the death of the life insured. The cost of life insurance varies based on a number of factors, such as, the age of the insured, smoking status, current health, and expected life expectancy. In exchange of premiums paid (monthly or annual payment made to insurance company), the insurer guarantees to pay a set amount of money to your beneficiary if you pass away during the life of the policy.

This is why you should discuss with your advisor the different life events that will bring on different needs and what applies to you.

                              It's impossible to say, because the kind of coverage thatâ€™s right for you depends on your circumstances and financial goals. But, as stated it is highly recommended that you look at creating a plan that utilizes a combination of both. Term offers the greatest coverage (death benefit) for the lowest initial premium and is a great solution for people with temporary needs or a limited budget. Permanent insurance on the other hand, may make more sense if you anticipate a need for lifelong protection, or if the option of accumulating tax-deferred cash values is attractive to you.  Often, a combination of term and permanent insurance is the right answer.

                              An annual plan allows you to take any number of trips outside your Canadian home province or territory of residence that do not exceed your selected trip duration. Benefit limits are per insured per each trip, unless otherwise indicated. If your trip outside Canada is longer than your selected trip duration then you must top-up your coverage with us. If you do not top-up then you will not have coverage for any claim during your trip regardless of when the cause for claim arises.  You have the option to have the policy start date be the date of purchase or any date into the future up to a maximum of 120 days.

                              Determining how much life insurance you need requires an examination of your current and future financial obligations, along with the resources your family could tap.<br>
                              <br>
                              Your future obligations are a combination of what it would cost to help your surviving family members meet immediate and ongoing needs like funeral costs, taxes, food, clothing, utilities, mortgage payments, and your future obligations like college and retirement funding.<br>
                              <br>
                              The resources that your surviving family members could draw on to meet those obligations include your spouseâ€™s or partnerâ€™s income, savings and investments, other income producing assets, and any life insurance you might already own.<br>
                              <br>
                              The difference between the twoâ€”your financial obligations minus the resources your family has to meet those obligationsâ€”is the approximate amount of additional life insurance you need. If this sounds confusing, youâ€™re not alone. Thatâ€™s why most people turn to a qualified insurance professional when they want to figure out how much insurance they need.<br>
                              <br>
                              But if you donâ€™t feel youâ€™re ready to speak with an agent or want a preliminary sense of your needs before meeting with an agent, visit our Life Insurance Needs Calculator. It will walk you through the various questions you need to ask yourself and provide you with a rough estimate of how much life insurance you need to protect your family.

                              Many policies contain a provision that allows a terminally ill person to collect a significant portion of his or her policyâ€™s death benefit while still alive. The money can be used to get family finances in order, pay for uncovered medical expenses, or simply do certain things for your family or friends while you still can. Itâ€™s important to note that the amount taken out while still living is subtracted from the death benefit payments your beneficiaries receive, along with an interest charge for early payment of benefits.

                              Travel insurance offers protection against unexpected events that can happen before or during traveling. Traveling insurance will cover both minor and major accidents. Generally, basic insurance plans cover emergency medical costs, whereas, an all-inclusive policy normally covers flight delays, trip cancellation, baggage lost, and more. Keep in mind that most of the companies will not cover the risks listed on the Government of Canadaâ€™s travel advisory site.

                     Travel insurance is different than extended health insurance. While many extended health insurance plans include some coverage for travel, it is often a small amount. If you get sick or injured while outside of Canada, medical costs can add up quickly â€“ especially if you are hospitalized. Because of this, we recommend that you purchase insurance specific for travelling, even if you have some coverage under another plan. This will ensure that you have enough coverage for an emergency. Travel insurance policies can also include benefits or features that are not provided by group health insurance plans; these include non-medical benefits and 24/7 claims and emergency assistance.

                      You are not required to purchase additional insurance while travelling outside of your home province (but within Canada); however, it is strongly advised to get yourself some anyway. While your provincial health insurance will remain in effect outside of your province of residence, it is limited to expenses which would be covered in your home province. Because of the potential discrepancies in health care coverage from province to province, we recommend purchasing travel insurance. Plans for travel within Canada are available at very reasonable rates.

                      This represents the amount of eligible medical expenses that must be paid by the insured before the insurance company begins to reimburse for covered expenses. As an example, if you purchase a plan with a $50 deductible and incur $200 of expenses, the insurance company will begin to reimburse for expenses after you have paid the first $50 of your medical bills.<br>
                      There are two different kinds of deductibles,&nbsp;<strong>per-claim</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>per-policy period</strong>. A per claim deductible means that the insured must pay a new deductible for each separate incident. (Example: pay the deductible once for a broken leg and then a second time for a flu treatment). A per-policy period deductible means that the insured must pay the deductible only once during the period of the insurance policy. If your plan has a $100 deductible, you pay the first $100 of the expenses and then the insurance company picks up the rest. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium cost and vice versa.

                      Whenever possible, the insurance companies will try to coordinate direct payment with the hospital so that you do not have to pay out of pocket. It is important that you contact your insurerâ€™s Claims and Emergency Assistance department if you are in need of medical attention. This department will help you get the medical attention you need while attempting to coordinate payment at the facility where you are being treated. However, be aware that some medical facilities may insist on payment up front. If your policy has a deductible, this means that you will be responsible for a portion of the medical expenses incurred. This deductible is a dollar amount that you must pay before coverage kicks in. Deductibles vary from policy to policy, and can be applied on a per-claim or per-trip basis.
