                    <p>Critical illness is a stressful event for an individual and can disturb your fnancial balance manifold. Critical Illness Insurance can help you pay-off such fnancial overheads in life-altering illness. If you are insured under Critical Illness Insurance and the policy covers for the associated illness, you receive a lump-sum amount in cash to pay for the expenses. It can also be claimed under the circumstances where you have already paid for the expenses, the amount hence received can be used to recover the loss of income. Critical Illness covers for a variety of illnesses and accidents like: Heart Attacks, Strokes, Cancer, physical disabilities, Alzheimer’s disease, etc</p>

                <div class="travel-medical-paragraph" style="margin-top:20px;">
                      <p>Critical Illness Insurance also covers the cost if you have to travel out of the country for treatment. Statistics say it all; anyone can face such life-changing event. According to statistics, on an average over 70,000 Canadians go through heart attacks and between 40,000 to 50,000 strokes every year. Also over 3000 people are diagnosed with cancer every week in Canada. These are some shocking statistics and hence critical illness insurance is recommended to all.</p>

                              There is a huge difference between life insurance and critical illness insurance. Term or permanent life insurance is a benefit that will be paid to your family and beneficiaries after your death. On the other hand, in critical illness insurance, you will be the one to receive reimbursements for critical illness, not your family or beneficiaries. Furthermore, illness does not need to be terminal to collect benefits.

                              Life insurance, simply put, is insurance that will pay out a death benefit (lump sum of money) to a beneficiary (person you name who you want the money to go to) upon the death of the life insured. The cost of life insurance varies based on a number of factors, such as, the age of the insured, smoking status, current health, and expected life expectancy. In exchange of premiums paid (monthly or annual payment made to insurance company), the insurer guarantees to pay a set amount of money to your beneficiary if you pass away during the life of the policy.

This is why you should discuss with your advisor the different life events that will bring on different needs and what applies to you.

                              It's impossible to say, because the kind of coverage that’s right for you depends on your circumstances and financial goals. But, as stated it is highly recommended that you look at creating a plan that utilizes a combination of both. Term offers the greatest coverage (death benefit) for the lowest initial premium and is a great solution for people with temporary needs or a limited budget. Permanent insurance on the other hand, may make more sense if you anticipate a need for lifelong protection, or if the option of accumulating tax-deferred cash values is attractive to you.  Often, a combination of term and permanent insurance is the right answer.

                              An annual plan allows you to take any number of trips outside your Canadian home province or territory of residence that do not exceed your selected trip duration. Benefit limits are per insured per each trip, unless otherwise indicated. If your trip outside Canada is longer than your selected trip duration then you must top-up your coverage with us. If you do not top-up then you will not have coverage for any claim during your trip regardless of when the cause for claim arises.  You have the option to have the policy start date be the date of purchase or any date into the future up to a maximum of 120 days.

                              Determining how much life insurance you need requires an examination of your current and future financial obligations, along with the resources your family could tap.<br>
                              <br>
                              Your future obligations are a combination of what it would cost to help your surviving family members meet immediate and ongoing needs like funeral costs, taxes, food, clothing, utilities, mortgage payments, and your future obligations like college and retirement funding.<br>
                              <br>
                              The resources that your surviving family members could draw on to meet those obligations include your spouse’s or partner’s income, savings and investments, other income producing assets, and any life insurance you might already own.<br>
                              <br>
                              The difference between the two—your financial obligations minus the resources your family has to meet those obligations—is the approximate amount of additional life insurance you need. If this sounds confusing, you’re not alone. That’s why most people turn to a qualified insurance professional when they want to figure out how much insurance they need.<br>
                              <br>

                              Many policies contain a provision that allows a terminally ill person to collect a significant portion of his or her policy’s death benefit while still alive. The money can be used to get family finances in order, pay for uncovered medical expenses, or simply do certain things for your family or friends while you still can. It’s important to note that the amount taken out while still living is subtracted from the death benefit payments your beneficiaries receive, along with an interest charge for early payment of benefits.

                              Life insurance, simply put, is insurance that will pay out a death benefit (lump sum of money) to a beneficiary (person you name who you want the money to go to) upon the death of the life insured. The cost of life insurance varies based on a number of factors, such as, the age of the insured, smoking status, current health, and expected life expectancy. In exchange of premiums paid (monthly or annual payment made to insurance company), the insurer guarantees to pay a set amount of money to your beneficiary if you pass away during the life of the policy.

                              It's impossible to say, because the kind of coverage that’s right for you depends on your circumstances and financial goals. But, as stated it is highly recommended that you look at creating a plan that utilizes a combination of both. Term offers the greatest coverage (death benefit) for the lowest initial premium and is a great solution for people with temporary needs or a limited budget. Permanent insurance on the other hand, may make more sense if you anticipate a need for lifelong protection, or if the option of accumulating tax-deferred cash values is attractive to you.  Often, a combination of term and permanent insurance is the right answer.

                              An annual plan allows you to take any number of trips outside your Canadian home province or territory of residence that do not exceed your selected trip duration.

If you do not top-up then you will not have coverage for any claim during your trip regardless of when the cause for claim arises.  You have the option to have the policy start date be the date of purchase or any date into the future up to a maximum of 120 days.

                              Determining how much life insurance you need requires an examination of your current and future financial obligations, along with the resources your family could tap.<br>
                              <br>
                              Your future obligations are a combination of what it would cost to help your surviving family members meet immediate and ongoing needs like funeral costs, taxes, food, clothing, utilities, mortgage payments, and your future obligations like college and retirement funding.<br>
                              <br>
                              The resources that your surviving family members could draw on to meet those obligations include your spouse’s or partner’s income, savings and investments, other income producing assets, and any life insurance you might already own.<br>
                              <br>
                              The difference between the two—your financial obligations minus the resources your family has to meet those obligations—is the approximate amount of additional life insurance you need. If this sounds confusing, you’re not alone. That’s why most people turn to a qualified insurance professional when they want to figure out how much insurance they need.<br>

                              Many policies contain a provision that allows a terminally ill person to collect a significant portion of his or her policy’s death benefit while still alive. The money can be used to get family finances in order, pay for uncovered medical expenses, or simply do certain things for your family or friends while you still can. It’s important to note that the amount taken out while still living is subtracted from the death benefit payments your beneficiaries receive, along with an interest charge for early payment of benefits.
